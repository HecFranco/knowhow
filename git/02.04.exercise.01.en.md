* **title:** The Secret Diary of the Space Developer 🌌

**Greetings, future master of time and space in the code universe!** In this mission, you will use your newly acquired skills to discover the secrets hidden in the logbook of your space project. But not just any project... you are working on the code for the first intergalactic cafe on Mars: "The Martian Express". ☕  

#### Step 1: Preparing your Space Station (Your Repository)

Make sure you are in the correct directory. If you haven't started a repository for "The Martian Express" yet, it's time to do so:

```bash
mkdir the_martian_express
cd el_expreso_marciano
git init
```

#### Step 2: Creating the Intergalactic Cafe Menu

You have decided to create the menu for your cafe. Start by creating a file called `menu.txt` and add some of your favorite stellar coffees:

```bash
echo "Solar Coffee ☀️\nLunar Latte 🌙\nCosmic Cappuccino 🌌" > menu.txt
```

#### Step 3: Using `git status` to Inspect the Area

Before we proceed, we want to make sure we know what is happening in our project. Use the `git status` command to see the status of the files:

```bash
gitstatus
```

You will see that `menu.txt` is uncrawled. Wow, it looks like we have an unidentified alien document! 🛸

#### Step 4: Preparing the Menu for Launch

It's time to prepare `menu.txt` for its big debut. Use `git add` to add it to the staging area:

```bash
git add menu.txt
```

And check again with `git status` to make sure it's ready for the next big step.

#### Step 5: Documenting the Discovery with `git commit`

Now that our menu is ready, let's document this milestone with `git commit`:

```bash
git commit -m "I add

the initial menu for The Martian Express"
```

#### Step 6: Traveling Through Time with `git log`

After securing your precious menu in your project history, it's time to take a look back and see the steps you've taken. Use `git log` to reveal the history of your commits:

```bash
gitlog
```

Contemplate the record of your adventures. You'll see details about your commit, including the message "I added the starting menu for The Martian Express," along with the author and date. 🚀📜

#### Step 7: Breaking Update 🚨

Breaking news! A new coffee bean has been discovered on Jupiter's moon Io. It's time to add the "Espresso Io" to your menu:

```bash
echo "Espresso Io   " >> menu.txt
```

Use `git status` to verify your changes and repeat the `git add` and `git commit` steps to update your menu:

```bash
git add menu.txt
git commit -m "I update the menu with Espresso Io"
```

#### 🤔 Conclusion

Congratulations! 🎉 You have successfully handled `git status` and `git log` to navigate the current status and history of your space project. Now you have the tools to keep your project organized and document every important step in your development journey.

Remember, each commit is like a star in the constellation sky of development; Together, they light the path to your ultimate goal. Keep exploring and documenting your journey with Git!
