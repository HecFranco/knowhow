**Hello, brilliant explorers of the code universe!** ðŸŒŸðŸš€ Welcome to the next station of our adventure with Git, where we will learn how to use the powerful navigation tools: `git status` and `git log`. These tools are essential for any code time traveler, allowing them to inspect the present and review the annals of the past. So fasten your seat belts, because we are going to take off towards knowledge!

#### Using `git status` to View Current Status

Imagine that you are in the middle of modifying your spaceship (project) and you need to know which parts (files) are modified, which are ready to be saved in history (staged), and which are not yet being tracked by Git. This is where `git status` shines like a star:

{.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
```bash
gitstatus
```

This command will give you a clear summary of everything that is happening in your repository. For example, if you have modified a file called `motor_hyperdrive.txt` but have not yet added it to the staging area, `git status` will let you know. ðŸš€

#### Exploring the Past with `git log`

Once you've traveled the code galaxy and made several commits, you might want to look back and see the story of your journey. This is where `git log` comes into play:

{.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
```bash
gitlog
```

This command shows you a list of all the commits you have made, including details such as the commit author, date, and commit message. It's like having a logbook of your space trip in code. If you want to see something more specific, such as changes to a specific file, you can use:

{.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
```bash
git log --follow filename
```
#### Practical example

Let's say you've been working on a project to build a space flight simulator. You have added a new file called `simulator.js` and made some changes to `README.md`.

1. To see the current status of your changes:

   {.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
   ```bash
   gitstatus
   ```
{.alert .alert-info}
This will show you that `simulator.js` is untracked and that `README.md` has been modified but is not ready to commit.

2. After preparing and committing your changes, you want to review your history:

   {.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
   ```bash
   gitlog
   ```

{.alert .alert-info}
Here you'll see a log of all your commits, including the last one that added `simulator.js` and updated `README.md`.

#### ðŸ¤” Conclusion

With `git status` and `git log`, you have the power to monitor the current status of your project and review your change history, respectively. They are indispensable tools in your Git arsenal that help you keep your project organized and your history clear. Use these commands to become a master of time and space in your coding projects!
