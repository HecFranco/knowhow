* **description:** Staged, modified, committed.

**Hello, code adventurers!** ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the fourth stage of our odyssey through the Git universe. In this mission, we are going to unravel the mysteries of the three essential states of Git: **Staged**, **Modified**, and **Committed**. Additionally, we will explore the life cycle of files in Git. Get your curiosity engines ready, because we're going to dive into the heart of the most powerful version control system in the galaxy. ðŸš€

#### The Three States of Git

Git handles your files in three main states, which describe the life cycle of a file from when you make changes to when you save them to your version history:

1. **Modified:** Indicates that you have made changes to a file that have not yet been committed to your Git database. This is the first step in the life cycle of your changes.
   
2. **Staged:** Once you select the changes you want to commit, they go to the "staged" state. This means that your modifications are marked to be included in your next commit, but they are not yet part of your version history.
   
3. **Committed:** This status indicates that your changes are safe in your Git database; you've taken a snapshot of your changes and saved them to your version history.

#### File Lifecycle in Git

To illustrate how this life cycle works, imagine that you are writing the script for a play about hackers in the file `piratas_del_ciberespacio.txt`.

1. **Start:** You create the file `piratas_del_ciberespacio.txt` and write some lines. The file is in the **modified** state because you have made changes that you have not yet prepared for a commit.

2. **Preparation:** You decide you are happy with the changes and prepare them for commit using the `git add pirates_del_cyberespacio.txt` command. Now the file is in **staged** state.

3. **Commit:** You commit your changes with `git commit -m "I add the first act of cyberspace pirates"`. The file goes into **committed** state. Your changes are now safe in your version history!

#### Practical example

Let's put this into practice. Open your Terminal or Git Bash and follow these steps:

{.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
```bash
echo "Act 1: The hackers set sail" > cyberspace_pirates.txt
git status # You will see that pirates_del_ciberespacio.txt is in modified status.
git add cyberspace_pirates.txt
git status # It is now in staged state.
git commit -m "Start hacker script"
git status # All changes are committed.
```

#### ðŸ¤” Conclusion

**Congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully navigated the three states of Git and learned the file life cycle. Understanding these concepts is crucial to managing your projects with Git and ensuring that your adventures in code are successful and conflict-free.
