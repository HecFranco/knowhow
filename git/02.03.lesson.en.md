**Hello, brave sailors of the digital sea!** ðŸŒŠ In this exciting journey of our Git adventure, we are going to learn how to take the treasures of our changes and secure them in the chest of our repository using the `add` and `commit commands `. These steps are crucial in every developer's journey, allowing us to keep a detailed record of our conquests and explorations. Let's set sail towards knowledge! âš“

#### Adding Files to the Staging Area with `add`

Imagine that you have discovered an island full of unexplored codes. You have decided to make some changes to the treasure map (`treasure_map.txt`) and you want to make sure these changes are not lost.

1. **Exploring Changes**: You have modified `treasure_map.txt` with new directions to the hidden treasure. These changes are currently in **modified** status.

2. **Marking Treasure for Collection**:
To prepare your changes for the next commit, you use the command:

   {.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
   ```bash
   git add treasure_map.txt
   ```

{.alert .alert-info}
Now your changes are **staged** and ready to be documented in your ship's logbook (your repository)!

#### Documenting the Trip with `commit`

You've marked the map and now it's time to write in your logbook to remember what changes you made and why.

1. **Writing in the Diary**:
With the changes prepared, it's time to commit:

   {.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
   ```bash
   git commit -m "I update the map with the location of the hidden treasure"
   ```

This commit message is like a journal entry, explaining what you did and why. Now, these changes are secure (**committed**) in your repository.

#### Practical example

Suppose you are developing a video game and you have created a new level called `secret_level.txt`.

1. **You create the file** and write the first lines of code.
2. **You add the file to the staging area**:

   {.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
   ```bash
   git add secret_level.txt
   ```

3. **You commit your work**:

   {.no-line-numbers .command-line data-prompt="$"}
   ```bash
   git commit -m "I add a secret level to the game"
   ```

4. You **check the status** with `git status` to make sure everything is **committed**.

#### ðŸ¤” Conclusion

**Congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ You've learned how to mark and document your discoveries like a true code pirate. The `add` and `commit` commands are essential in your Git arsenal, allowing you to manage your changes efficiently and keep a clear record of the evolution of your project.
