* **title:** The Pirate Archives Adventure 🏴‍☠️

**Ahoy, brave coders!** Prepare your sails and anchor your keyboards, as we are going to embark on a git-astic adventure to discover the hidden treasures of the three states of Git: **Modified**, **Staged* *, and **Committed**. Through the Sea of ​​Codes, you will write the legend of the brave hackers in the file `pirate_legend.txt`. Boarding! 🚢

#### Step 1: Ship Configuration (Your Repository)

First, make sure you have a repository ready for this adventure. If you don't have one, it's time to create one:

```bash
mkdir pirate_adventure_git
cd pirate_adventure_git
git init
```

This will be the ship you will sail on. Now, prepare your pirate flag:

```bash
echo "🏴‍☠️ The Flag of the Code Pirates 🏴‍☠️" > legend_pirata.txt
```

#### Step 2: Navigating the Changed Waters

Arrr! You have created a new file. It's time to check what status it is in. Use your git spyglass:

```bash
gitstatus
```

You will see that `legend_pirata.txt` is in **modified** state. Land in sight! But it is not yet part of our treasure.

#### Step 3: Capturing the Treasure (Staging Area)

In order for our treasure (changes) to be captured and ready to be stored in the warehouse (repository), we must add it to the staging area:

```bash
git add pirate_legend.txt
```

Use your `git status` spyglass again to see how `legend_pirata.txt` has moved to the **staged** state. The treasure is almost assured!

#### Step 4: Burying the Treasure (Commit)

Now that the treasure is ready, it's time to bury it on a safe island. We will make a commit to secure our loot:

```bash
git commit -m "I add the legend of the code pirates"
```

With your `git status` spyglass, you can see that the changes are now in **committed** status. The treasure is safe on Git Island!

#### Step 5: Celebrating with the Crew

Congratulations! 🎉 You have successfully navigated through the three states of Git and learned how to modify, prepare, and secure your changes to the repository. Now you have a legend to tell and a treasure of Git knowledge to share.

#### 🤔 Conclusion

In this adventure, you have learned to manage the three essential states of Git and the life cycle of files. Remember, each file in your project can be like a treasure in the sea of ​​Git, and now you have the map and the tools to navigate these seas with confidence.

Raise your pirate flag and get ready for more adventures in the world of code! 🏴‍☠️
