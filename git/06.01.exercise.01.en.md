* **title:** The Odyssey of the Lost Code in the Enchanted Forest 🌲🔮

**Greetings, brave code adventurers!** Today you face a unique challenge: during your latest expedition through the Enchanted Forest of Gitlandia, you have accumulated several magical artifacts (commits) in your bag (repository). However, upon closer inspection, you realize that some of these artifacts are cursed (unwanted commits) and could jeopardize your mission. Armed with the powerful `git reset` spell, you will undertake a quest to undo these dangerous changes and restore order to your bag of artifacts. 🧙‍♂️💼

#### Preparations for Adventure

Make sure you are at the heart of your bag (local repository):

```bash
cd my-enchanted-repository
```

Before you begin, examine your recent artifacts with:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

#### Step 1: Identification of the Cursed Artifact 📜

Your wisdom tells you that the third artifact from the last one (commit) is cursed. You decide to use your powers to undo this evil without disturbing the beneficial artifacts collected after it.

#### Step 2: Invoking `git reset --soft` 🌟

You want to keep the changes to the cursed artifacts in your bag, in case some of their magic can still be saved. So, you decide:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~3
```

Artifacts (commits) are stripped of their power (undo commits), but their essences (changes) still reside in your bag, waiting to be examined.

#### Step 3: The Reassessment and the New Enchantment ✨

After examining the changes, you decide that one of the artifacts can be purified (a specific file has useful changes). You prepare a new enchantment that preserves that beneficial magic:

```bash
git add saved_file.txt
git commit -m "I purify the magic of the cursed artifact for our use"
```

#### Step 4: The `git reset --hard` Spell for Full Reset 🚫

During your quest, you find an artifact that you inadvertently summoned (incorrect commit) and that must be completely eradicated, along with any trace of its existence in your bag. With determination, you recite:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

This powerful magic erases the cursed artifact and all the changes it brought, restoring peace to your sac.

#### 🤔 Conclusion

You've learned to deftly wield the `git reset` spell in its various forms, a crucial tool for any code wizard facing the whims of fate (or code bugs). Remember, each variant of the spell has its purpose and must be used wisely.

May your adventure through the Enchanted Forest of Gitlandia have taught you the importance of caution and knowledge when undoing ancient magic (previous commits). May your future quests be free of curses and full of triumphs!
