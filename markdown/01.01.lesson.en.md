#### What is Markdown?

This language was created in 2004 by John Gruber, and is distributed free of charge under a BSD license.

Almost all Markdown applications support the basic syntax described in John Gruber's original design document. Although there are small variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors.

#### Headings

To create a title, simply add `#` in front of a word or phrase. The number of `#` you use must correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a level three header `<h3>`, we will use three numeric signs (for example, `### My Header`).
| Markdown                 | HTML                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `# Heading level 1`      |	`<h1>Heading level 1</h1>` |
| `## Heading level 2`     |  `<h2>Heading level 2</h2>` |	
| `### Heading level 3`    |  `<h3>Heading level 3</h3>` |
| `#### Heading level 4`   |  `<h4>Heading level 4</h4>` |
| `##### Heading level 5`  |  `<h5>Heading level 5</h5>` |
| `###### Heading level 6` |  `<h6>Heading level 6</h6>` |


### Sintaxis alternativa<a id="#Sintaxis-alternativa"></a>

Alternatively, on the line below the text, we can add any number of `==` characters for heading level 1 or `--` characters for heading level 2.
**Markdown**

```markdown
Heading level 1
===============
```

**HTML**, 

```html
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
```

**Markdown**
```markdown
Heading level 2
---------------
```

**HTML**,
```HTML
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
```

### Heading Best Practices<a id="#Heading-Best-Practices"></a>

Markdown applications disagree on how to handle a missing space in headers (`#`) and the header name. For compatibility, the ideal is to always put a space between the number signs and the name of the heading.

‚úÖ  Do this, `# Here's a Heading`

‚ùå  Don't do this . `#Here's a Heading` 

You must also put blank lines before and after a title for it to be compatible.

‚úÖ  Do this

```markdown
Try to put a blank line before...

# Heading

...and after a heading.	Without blank lines, this might not look right.
```
‚ùå  Don't do this 

```markdown
Without blank lines, this might not look right.
# Heading
Don't do this!
```

## Paragraphs<a id="Paragraphs"></a>

> üìì  Para crear p√°rrafos, utilice una l√≠nea en blanco para separar una o varias l√≠neas de texto.

**Markdown**

```markdown
I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.
```

**HTML**

```html
<p>I really like using Markdown.</p>

<p>I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.</p>	
```

**Salida renderizada**

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

### Best Practices for Paragraphs<a id="#Best-Practices-for-Paragraphs"></a>
Unless the paragraph is in a list, it should not be indented with spaces or tabs.

‚úÖ  Do this

```markdown
Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.
```

‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
    This can result in unexpected formatting problems.

  Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs.
```

## Line break<a id="Line-break"></a>

To create a line break (`<br>`), we will need to end the line with two or more spaces and then type `return`.

**Markdown**

```markdown
This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.
```
**HTML**

```html
<p>This is the first line.<br>
And this is the second line.</p>	
```

**Rendered output**	
This is the first line.
And this is the second line.


### Best Practices for Line Breaks<a id="#Best-Practices-for-Line-Breaks"></a>

Two or more spaces (commonly called trailing whitespace) can be used for line breaks in almost all Markdown applications, but this is controversial. Trailing whitespace is difficult to see in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after each sentence. For this reason, you may want to use more than just trailing white space for line breaks. If your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the `<br>` HTML tag.

> üìì For greater compatibility, you can use trailing whitespace or the HTML `<br>` tag at the end of the line.

There are two other options that I do not recommend using. **CommonMark** and some other lightweight markup languages ‚Äã‚Äãallow you to write a backslash (`\`) at the end of the line, but not all Markdown applications support it, so it's not a great option from the perspective of compatibility. And at least a couple of lightweight markup languages ‚Äã‚Äãdon't require anything at the end of the line - just type `return` and they'll create a line break.

‚úÖ  Do this	

```markdown
First line with two spaces after.  
And the next line.

First line with the HTML tag after.<br>
And the next line.
```

‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
First line with a backslash after.\
And the next line.

First line with nothing after.
And the next line.
```

## Emphasis<a id="Emphasis"></a>

We can add emphasis by bolding or italicizing the text.

### Bold<a id="#Bold"></a>

> üìì To make text bold, just add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the center of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

**Markdown**

```markdown
I just love **bold text**.
I just love __bold text__.
Love**is**bold
```

**HTML**	

```html
I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.
I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.	
Love<strong>is</strong>bold
```

**Rendered Output**

I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.
I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.
Love<strong>is</strong>bold

#### Best Practices for Bold<a id="#Best-Practices-for-Bold"></a>

Markdown applications don't agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, you should use `*` asterisks to bold the middle of a word for emphasis.

‚úÖ  Do this

```markdown
Love**is**bold
```

‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
Love__is__bold
```

### Italics<a id="#Italics"></a>

To italicize text, we will add an asterisk or an underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the center of a word for emphasis, we add an asterisk without spaces around the letters.

**Markdown**	

```markdown
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.
A*cat*meow
```

**HTML**	

```html
Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.
Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.
A<em>cat</em>meow
```

**Rendered Output**

Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.
Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.
A<em>cat</em>meow

#### Best Practices for Italics<a id="#Best-Practices-for-Italics"></a>

Again Markdown applications don't agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, we should use asterisks to italicize the middle of a word for emphasis.

‚úÖ  Do this

```markdown
A*cat*meow
```


‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
A_cat_meow
```

### Bold and Italics<a id="#Bold-and-Italics"></a>

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, we will add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the center of a word to emphasize it, we must also add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

**Markdown**	

```markdown
This text is ***really important***.
This text is ___really important___.
This text is __*really important*__.
This text is **_really important_**.
This is really***very***important text.
```

**HTML**

```html
This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This is really<strong><em>very</em></strong>important text.
```

**Salida renderizada**

This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This is really<strong><em>very</em></strong>important text.

#### Best Practices for Bold and Italics<a id="#Best-Practices-for-Bold-and-Italics"></a>

Markdown applications don't agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold and italicize the center of a word for emphasis.

‚úÖ  Do this

```markdown
This is really***very***important text.
```

‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
This is really___very___important text.
```
