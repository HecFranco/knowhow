## Blockquotes<a id="Blockquotes"></a>

To create a blockquote, we'll add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

```markdown
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

---

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

---

### Blockquotes with multiple paragraphs<a id="#Blockquotes-with-multiple-paragraphs"></a>

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. We can add a `>` on the blank lines between paragraphs.

```markdown
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

---

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

---

### Nested Blockquotes<a id="#Nested-blockquotes"></a>

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a `>>` in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

```markdown
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

---

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

---

### Blockquotes with Other Elements<a id="#Blockquotes-with-other-elements"></a>

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown-formatted elements.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  Not all elements can be used - you'll have to experiment to see which ones work üòì.

```markdown
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

---

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

---

### Best Practices for Blockquotes<a id="#Best-practices-for-blockquotes"></a>

For compatibility reasons, it's ideal to put blank lines before and after blockquotes.

‚úÖ  Do this	

```markdown
Try to put a blank line before...

> This is a blockquote

...and after a blockquote.
```

‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
Without blank lines, this might not look right.
> This is a blockquote
Don't do this!
```

## Lists<a id="Lists"></a>

We can organize items in ordered and unordered lists.

### Ordered Lists<a id="#Ordered-lists"></a>

To create an ordered list, add items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers do not need to be in order, but the list should start with the number one.

**Markdown**

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
1. Fourth item

1. First item
8. Second item
3. Third item
5. Fourth item

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item
```

**HTML**	

```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item
    <ol>
      <li>Indented item</li>
      <li>Indented item</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ol>	
```

**Rendered Output**

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

---

1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
1. Fourth item

---

1. First item
8. Second item
3. Third item
5. Fourth item

---

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

#### Best Practices for Ordered Lists<a id="##Best-practices-for-ordered-lists"></a>

**CommonMark** and some other lightweight markup languages allow the use of a parenthesis `)` as a delimiter (`for example, 1) First item`), but not all Markdown applications support it, so it's not a great choice from a compatibility standpoint. For compatibility, use only periods.

‚úÖ  Do this	

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
```

‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
1) First item
2) Second item
```

---

[Back to Index](#Index)

### Unordered Lists<a id="#Unordered-lists"></a>

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of the items. To create a nested list, indent one or more items.

**Markdown**	

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item	

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item
+ Fourth item

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item
```

**HTML**	

```html
<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>	

<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>	

<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>	

<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item
    <ul>
      <li>Indented item</li>
      <li>Indented item</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>	
```

**Rendered Output**

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item	

---

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

---

+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item
+ Fourth item

---

- First item
- Second item
-

 Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item

#### Starting Unordered List Items with Numbers<a id="##Starting-unordered-list-items-with-numbers"></a>

If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a dot, you can use a backslash (`\`) to escape the dot.

**Markdown**	

```markdown
- 1968\. A great year!
- I think 1969 was second best.
```

**HTML**

```html
<ul>
  <li>1968. A great year!</li>
  <li>I think 1969 was second best.</li>
</ul>
```

**Rendered Output**
		
- 1968\. A great year!
- I think 1969 was second best.

#### Best Practices for Unordered Lists<a id="##Best-practices-for-unordered-lists"></a>

Markdown applications do not agree on how to handle different delimiters in the same list. For compatibility reasons, do not mix delimiters in the same list: choose one and stick with it.

‚úÖ  Do this	

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item	
```

‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
+ First item
* Second item
- Third item
+ Fourth item
```

### Adding Elements in Lists<a id="#Adding-elements-in-lists"></a>

To add an additional element in a list while maintaining the list's continuity, simply indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

> üí°  **Tip:** If things don't appear as you expect, check that you've indented the list elements four spaces or one tab.

#### Paragraphs<a id="##Paragraphs"></a>

```markdown
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.
```

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

#### Blockquotes<a id="##Blockquotes"></a>

```markdown
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

---

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

---

#### Code Blocks<a id="##Code-blocks"></a>

Code blocks are typically indented four spaces or one tab. When in a list, they're indented eight spaces or two tabs.

```markdown
1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Test</title>
      </head>
    ```

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

---

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

  ```html
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Test</title>
    </head>
  ```

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.

---

#### Images<a id="##Images"></a>

```markdown
1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.

    ![Tux, the Linux mascot](https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/b4803b7aa7db1c560298105611410a70/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2021/08/11/16286547533760.jpg)

3. Close the file.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

---

1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.

    <img alt="Tux, the Linux mascot" src="https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/b4803b7aa7db1c560298105611410a70/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2021/08/11/16286547533760.jpg" width="150px"/>

3. Close the file.

---

#### Lists<a id="##Lists"></a>

You can nest an unordered list within an ordered list, or vice versa.

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
4. Fourth item
```

The rendered output looks like this:

---

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
4. Fourth item

## Code<a id="Code"></a>

To indicate a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`\``).

**Markdown**

```markdown
At the command prompt, type `nano`.	
```

**HTML**

```html
At the command prompt, type <code>nano</code>.
```

**Rendered Output**

At the command prompt, type `nano`.

---

[Back to Index](#Index)

## Escaping Backticks<a id="Escaping-backticks"></a>

If the word or phrase you want to indicate as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (` `` `).

**Markdown**

```markdown
``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``
```

**HTML**

```html
<code>Use `code` in your Markdown file.</code>
```

**Rendered Output**

``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``

## Code Blocks<a id="Code-blocks"></a>

To create code blocks, indent each line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

```markdown
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>
```

The rendered output looks like this:

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

> üìù  To create code blocks without indenting the lines, use fenced code blocks.

## Horizontal Rules<a id="Horizontal-rules"></a>

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (`***`), dashes (`---`), or underscores (`___`) on a single line.

```markdown
***

---

_________________
```

The **Rendered Output** for all three types should look similar to:

***

---

_________________

## Best Practices for Horizontal Rules<a id="#Best-practices-for-horizontal-rules"></a>

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.

‚úÖ  Do this	

```markdown
Try to put a blank line before...

---

...and after a horizontal rule.
```

‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
Without blank lines, this would be a heading.
---
Don't do this!
```

## Links<a id="Links"></a>

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., `[Duck Duck Go]`) and then immediately follow it with the URL in parentheses (e.g., `(https://duckduckgo.com)`).

```markdown
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
```

The rendered output looks like this:

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

> üìù  For linking to an element on the same page, see linking to header IDs.

### Adding Titles<a id="#Adding-titles"></a>

You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in quotation marks after the URL.

```markdown
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
```

The rendered output looks like this:

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").

### URLs and Email Addresses<a id="#URLs-and-Email-addresses"></a>

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

```markdown
<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>
```

The rendered output looks like this:

<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>

### Formatting Links<a id="#Formatting-links"></a>

To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the parentheses and brackets. To denote links as code, add backticks in the parentheses.

```markdown
I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**.
This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*.
See the section on [`code`](#code).
```

The rendered output looks like this:

I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**.
This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*.
See the section on [`code`](#code).

### Restyling Links<a id="#Restyling-links"></a>

Reference styles for links are a special kind of link that makes URLs easier to view and read in Markdown.

Reference styles for links are built in two parts: the part that stays in line with the text and the part that is stored elsewhere in the file to make the text easy to read.

#### Format of the First Part of the Link<a id="##Format-of-the-first-part-of-the-link"></a>

The first part of a reference style link is formatted with two sets of brackets. The first set of brackets surrounds the text that should appear linked. The second set of brackets shows a label used to signal the link you're storing elsewhere in your document.

You can include a space between the first and second set of brackets, though it's not necessary. The label in the second set of brackets is case-insensitive and can include letters, numbers, spaces, or punctuation.

This means the following example formats are roughly equivalent for the first part of the link:

```markdown
[hobbit-hole][1]
[hobbit-hole] [1]
```

#### Format of the Second Part of the Link<a id="##Format-of-the-second-part-of-the-link"></a>

The second part of a reference style link is formatted with the following attributes:

The label, in brackets, followed immediately by a colon and at least one space (e.g., `[label]:`).

The URL of the link, which can optionally be enclosed in angle brackets.

The optional title of the link, which can be enclosed in double quotes, single quotes, or parentheses.
This means the following example formats are all roughly equivalent for the second part of the link:

```markdown
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle 'Hobbit lifestyles'
[1]: https://en

.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle (Hobbit lifestyles)
[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> "Hobbit lifestyles"
[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> 'Hobbit lifestyles'
[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> (Hobbit lifestyles)
```

You can place this second part of the link anywhere in your Markdown document. Some people place them immediately following the paragraph in which they appear, while others place them at the end of the document (like endnotes or footnotes).

#### Example of All Parts Together<a id="##Example-of-all-parts-together"></a>

Let's say you add a URL as a standard link in a paragraph, and it looks like this in Markdown:

```markdown
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a [hobbit-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"), and that means comfort.
```

Although it may point to interesting additional information, the URL as shown really doesn't add much to the existing plain text, aside from making it harder to read. To fix that, you could format the URL like this:

```markdown
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> "Hobbit lifestyles"
```

In both previous cases, the **Rendered Output** would be identical:

```
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
```

and the HTML for the link would be:

```html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle" title="Hobbit lifestyles">hobbit-hole</a>
```

### Best Practices for Links<a id="#Best-practices-for-links"></a>

Markdown applications do not agree on how to handle spaces in the middle of a URL. For compatibility, try to encode spaces in the URL with `%20`.

‚úÖ  Do this	

```markdown
[link](https://www.example.com/my%20great%20page)
```

‚ùå  Don't do this

```markdown
[link](https://www.example.com/my great page)
```

## Images<a id="Images"></a>

To add an image, add an exclamation mark (`!`), followed by the alt text in brackets, and the path or URL of the image asset in parentheses. Optionally, you can add a title after the URL in quotes.

```markdown
![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](https://mdg.imgix.net/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg?auto=format&fit=clip&q=40&w=1080 "San Juan Mountains")
```

The rendered output looks like this:

![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](https://mdg.imgix.net/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg?auto=format&fit=clip&q=40&w=1080 "San Juan Mountains")

### Linking Images<a id="#Linking-images"></a>

To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

```markdown
[![An old rock in the desert](/assets/images/shiprock.jpg "Shiprock, New Mexico by Beau Rogers")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/beaurogers/31833779864/in/photolist-Qv3rFw-34mt9F-a9Cmfy-5Ha3Zi-9msKdv-o3hgjr-hWpUte-4WMsJ1-KUQ8N-deshUb-vssBD-6CQci6-8AFCiD-zsJWT-nNfsgB-dPDwZJ-bn9JGn-5HtSXY-6CUhAL-a4UTXB-ugPum-KUPSo-fBLNm-6CUmpy-4WMsc9-8a7D3T-83KJev-6CQ2bK-nNusHJ-a78rQH-nw3NvT-7aq2qf-8wwBso-3nNceh-ugSKP-4mh4kh-bbeeqH-a7biME-q3PtTf-brFpgb-cg38zw-bXMZc-nJPELD-f58Lmo-bXMYG-bz8AAi-bxNtNT-bXMYi-bXMY6-bXMYv)

## Escape Characters<a id="Escape-characters"></a>

To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (`\`) before the character.

```markdown
\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

### Characters That Can Be Escaped<a id="#Characters-that-can-be-escaped"></a>

You can use a backslash to escape the following characters.

**Character Name**
`\`	backslash
` ` `	backtick (see also escaping backticks in code)
`*`	asterisk
`_`	underscore
`{ }`	curly braces
`[ ]`	brackets
`< >`	angle brackets
`( )`	parentheses
`#`	pound sign
`+`	plus sign
`-`	minus sign (hyphen)
`.`	dot
`!`	exclamation mark
`|`	pipe (see also escaping pipe in tables)

[Back to Index](#Index)

## HTML<a id="HTML"></a>

Many Markdown applications allow the use of HTML tags in Markdown-formatted text. This is useful if you prefer certain HTML tags over Markdown syntax. For example, some people find it easier to use HTML tags for images. Using HTML is also helpful when you need to change attributes of an element, such as specifying the color of text or changing the width of an image.

To use HTML, place the tags in the text of your Markdown file.

```markdown
This **word** is bold.  This <em>word</em> is italic.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

This **word** is bold.  This <em>word</em> is italic.

## Best Practices for HTML<a id="#Best-practices-for-HTML"></a>

For security reasons, not all Markdown applications support HTML in Markdown documents. When in doubt, check the documentation for your Markdown application. Some applications only support a subset of HTML tags.

Use blank lines to separate block-level HTML elements like `<div>`, `<table>`, `<pre>`, and `<p>` from surrounding content. Try not to indent tags with tabs or spaces - that can interfere with formatting.

You can't use Markdown syntax inside block-level HTML tags. For example, `<p>italic and **bold**</p>` won't work.
